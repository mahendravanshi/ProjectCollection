I have worked on frontend even after not knowing it, i ahve worked on nextjs.
I have also worked as team lead for 1 month and completed all the milestones.
I have never given a chance of escalation
I have also helped my team collegeus bytaking their mock for interview preparation

Apart from this i have also learned some lessons like that people used to not put the tea cup after drinking the dustbin but once after Shashi sir told about this i started doing it to keep it in dustbin

Also i was not active in general channel, i have started wishing each and every one in the group once sagar sir told me about it
