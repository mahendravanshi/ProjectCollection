SDLC

Waterfall Method => 

It is a SDLC method which  is also knownn as linear sequential method.


Ther are mainly several process in a SDLC such as
1. Requirement Analysis => The requirement analysis is done and its feasibility is checked.
2. System Design => Then  the system design part is done 
3. Develpement => Inthis SDLC the software is developed and it is moved to the testing part.
4. Testing => The software is then moved to the testing part where the unit testing and integraton testing is done simultaneously.
5. Deployment/Production => The software is then released into the production phase and nit is deployed to the end user for use.
6. Maintenance => After taking the feedback from the end user the patches are released also to enhance the versions the better versions are released.


Agile

Unlike Waterfall Model very little planning is required to get started with the project.
Agile assumes that the users needs are ever-changing in a dynamic business and IT world

Agile methodology is a practice that promotes continuous iteration of development and testing over sdlc.
Instead of big launch we develop small and do cointinuos iterations over the sdlc by taking feedback from the customer



How @Autowired works

@Autowired is a Spring annotation used for automatic dependency injection. When you mark a field, method, or constructor with @Autowired, Spring automatically injects the appropriate bean into that component at runtime.
